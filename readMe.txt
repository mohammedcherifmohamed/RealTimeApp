!!___________!!!! DONT FORGET THE DOT IF YOU USE BROADCASTAS IN EVENT LISTNER !!!! _____________!!!!!
So:
‚úÖ Rule of thumb:

If it must appear instantly in the UI ‚Üí ShouldBroadcastNow
If it‚Äôs okay to wait for a queue ‚Üí ShouldBroadcast

If you want user 1 to send to user 2, broadcast on chat.2.

If you want user 2 to send to user 1, broadcast on chat.1.

| Action                | Channel Name           | Listens to    | Description               |
| --------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------- | ------------------------- |
| User sends message    | `chat.{receiver_id}`   | Receiver only | Receiver gets new message |
| User typing indicator | `typing.{receiver_id}` | Receiver only | Show "user is typing..."  |
| Group chat            | `group.{group_id}`     | All members   | Everyone gets updates     |


| Action         | Channel             | Sent From               | Received By | Data               |
| -------------- | ------------------- | ----------------------- | ----------- | ------------------ |
| Send message   | `chat.{receiverId}` | Backend (MessageEvent)  | Receiver    | message data       |
| Typing whisper | `chat.{receiverId}` | Frontend (Echo whisper) | Receiver    | `{ userId, name }` |




üîÅ Example full flow:

You join:

Laravel sends the full list of connected users to your .here(users) callback.

Someone else joins:

You get .joining(user) with that new person‚Äôs data.

Someone leaves:

You get .leaving(user) with that person‚Äôs data, so you can remove them.
